/* This devicetree overlay enables the COO template application to run on
 * QEMU Cortex-M3 emulation. This is useful for testing ARM-specific code,
 * persistent settings, and watchdog behavior without physical hardware.
 *
 * Note: QEMU Cortex-M3 has limited GPIO support, so example_sensor and
 * blink_led devices are disabled. The main application logic, NVS, and
 * watchdog can still be tested. For a complete QEMU test with peripherals,
 * consider native_sim or native_posix targets which have better peripheral
 * emulation.
