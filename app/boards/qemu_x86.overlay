/* This devicetree overlay enables the COO template application to run on
 * QEMU x86 emulation. This is useful for testing logic, persistent settings,
 * and watchdog behavior without physical hardware.
 *
 * Note: QEMU x86 has no GPIO support, so example_sensor and blink_led
 * devices are disabled. The main application logic, NVS, and watchdog
 * can still be tested. For a complete QEMU test with peripherals, consider
 * native_sim or native_posix targets which have better peripheral emulation.
